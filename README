In this work, we developed a novel PVP predictor named PVPred-SCM which is an efficient and interpretable method 
for predicting and analyzing PVPs. 

To make a fair comparison with existing methods [8-16], the same benchmark and independent datasets 
derived from the work of [12] were taken to develop and validate the proposed model PVPred-SCM. 

These two datasets were specifically used to develop PVP predictors for discriminating PVPs from non-PVPs. 

In this study, the benchmark dataset consists of 99 PVPs (TR-positive.txt) and 208 non-PVPs (TR-negative.txt), 
while the independent dataset consists of 30 PVPs (Ind-positive.txt) and 64 non-PVPs (Ind-negative.txt). 

To validate the robustness of the proposed PVPred-SCM, we further tested and compared its performance using another 
independent dataset derived from Zhang et alâ€™s method [11] (containing 68 PVPs and 92 non-PVPs) (Independent from Zhang et al..xlsx).
